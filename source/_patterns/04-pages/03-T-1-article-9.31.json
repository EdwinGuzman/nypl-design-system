  "intro_1": "The deadline to apply is Friday, September 27, at 5 p.m. EDT",
  "intro_2": "The Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers is an international fellowship program open to people whose work will benefit directly from access to the collections at the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building—including academics, independent scholars, and creative writers (novelists, playwrights, poets). Visual artists at work on a book project are also welcome to apply. The Center appoints 15 Fellows a year for a nine-month term at the Library, from September through May. In addition to working on their own projects, the Fellows engage in an ongoing exchange of ideas within the Center and in public forums throughout the Library.",

And that is the great privilege of the Cullman fellowship: to see where your mind takes you. To have the time and the resources to pursue your own intellectual adventure.",
