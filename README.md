## Installing this project
Download this code locally by running `git clone https://github.com/helenvholmes/patternlab.git` in your terminal or by hitting the green button that says "Clone or download" and downloading the zip. In the project folder, run `npm install` to fetch the project dependencies. If this fails, you might not have Node installed. Read about that [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Running this repository
To start the node server, run `npm start`. The project will run at `localhost:3000`.

You will need to run and compile the Sass by opening a new terminal window. Navigate to the css folder with `cd source/css`. Run `sass watch style.scss:style.css` to see your Sass changes in the project window.
